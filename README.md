# üß¨ Annotation Transfer Across the Microscope

This project focuses on **transferring annotation information across microscope magnification levels** ‚Äî for example, from 1000x to 400x and 100x ‚Äî to support multi-scale data labeling and efficient patch-level tracking. The goal is to enable **cross-scale annotation consistency** without the need to re-label at each scale manually.

## üîç Overview

In digital microscopy, especially in hematological or pathological studies, it's often required to:
- Label regions of interest (e.g., infected blood cells) at **1000x** magnification.
- Match or project these labels to **lower magnification views** (e.g., 400x or 100x) for context-aware data interpretation or training machine learning models.

This tool supports:
- Manual or semi-automated coordinate registration between magnification scales.
- Patch image extraction and overlay visualization.
- Coordinate conversion for annotation transfer.
- Integration with the **Olympus microscope tracking app**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Load high-magnification (1000x) image and corresponding annotations.
2. Select or compute transformation matrix to lower magnification levels.
3. Transfer and visualize annotations across views.
4. Export new annotated views as image-label pairs.
